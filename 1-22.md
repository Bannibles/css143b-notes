Have parent class have empty function if you plan to implement it to each child\
Interfaces are very abstract functions, method name and returns only, no implementation\
```
public interface ActionThisThingCanDo{
  private String name

  void play();
}
```
Static methods belong to the class\
Object is base class of all objects we make\
Use super keyword to go up a level in class and use its constructor\
